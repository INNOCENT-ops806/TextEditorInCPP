# TextEditorInCPP

## Description

This is a text editor written in C++ that provides basic functionality for editing text files. It offers a simple interface for creating, opening, and saving text files, as well as editing text within the editor.

## Features

- The text editor allows users to create new file, open an existing file, save the current file, and exit the application.

## Motivation

After few weeks of learning the C++ programming language I realised that I can make my own text editor for me by me :) so I am venturing into something that I use daily.

### The README will be updated as the project improves
